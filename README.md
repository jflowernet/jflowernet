My name is Jason and I'm a Project Researcher at the [Environmental Market Solutions Lab (emLab)](https://emlab.msi.ucsb.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara working on marine spatial planning and coastal and fisheries management on islands in the Caribbean, Pacific, and Western Indian Ocean. I work with emLabâ€™s partners at the [Waitt Institute](https://www.waittinstitute.org/) on their work with the [Blue Prosperity Coalition](https://www.blueprosperity.org/). My work has helped guide marine spatial planning in Montserrat and Bermuda, and inform fisheries management in Barbuda, Curacao, the Maldives, and Montserrat. 

I am also a Research Assistant for the [Foundation for Environmental Conservation](https://foundationforec.org/) and co-organised the Foundationâ€™s [7th International Conference on Environmental Future: Humans and Island Environments](https://foundationforec.org/7th-international-conference-on-environmental-future/) in 2018. 

Prior to starting at emLab in 2016, I worked on the EU funded Future of Reefs in a Changing Environment project in the [Marine Spatial Ecology Lab](https://www.marinespatialecologylab.org/) at the University of Queensland, Australia, where I developed a coral reef managersâ€™ handbook, "[Towards reef resilience and sustainable livelihoods: a handbook for Caribbean reef managers](https://www.marinespatialecologylab.org/coral-reef-managers-handbook)". I have worked for marine conservation NGOs in Honduras, Bonaire, Tobago and the Seychelles, doing reef surveys and restoration, teaching tropical marine conservation, and collaborating with and training local partners to aid conservation efforts. I have an MSc in Tropical Coastal Management from Newcastle University in the UK, and a BSc in Chemistry and Molecular Physics from the University of Nottingham, UK.
